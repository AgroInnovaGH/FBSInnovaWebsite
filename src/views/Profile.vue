                  <h4>Livelihood empowerment for farmers </h4>
                  <p style="margin-top:47px" class="description">
                    11% of the worldâ€™s population live in extreme poverty down from 28% in 1999 according to the UNDP. Globally, more than 800 million people are still living in less than US$ 1.25 a day and many more lack access to adequate food. Food insecurity is therefore a major fundamental issue for which Agro Innova seeks to address. Agro Innova is empowering small-holder farmers to maximize their efficiency through our tailor made technological tools which helps them manage their farms effectively and have access to guaranteed markets through cost reduction solutions and increasing profitability. At Agro Innova, we ensure that our farmers have access to technology and markets that puts them in better position to scale their businesses which helps in the poverty eradication agenda.

                <p style="margin-top:47px" class="description">
                  According to the ILO, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015. To lower this unemployment gap, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation is needed to drive the desired economic growth and promote decent work. Agro Innova contributes to this SDG through the deployment of our suite of digital technologies (like our mobile and web-based agricultural software FBS - Innova) to help achieve full,
                  productive and decent work for all men and women in agribusinesses.
